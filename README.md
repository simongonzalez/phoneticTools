# phoneticTools

Selection of functions (these functions are under development.) to facilitate data wrangling, visualisation and analysis of speech corpora. This is the result of an ARC-funded project under the Centre of Excelence for the Dynamics of Language (CoEDL), with the collaboration of:

* Simon Gonzalez (The Australian National University - simon.gonzalez@anu.edu.au),

* Gerry Docherty (Griffith University - gerry.docherty@griffith.edu.au),

* Janet Fletcher (The University of Melbourne - j.fletcher@unimelb.edu.au),

* and Hywel Stoakes (The University of Melbourne - hstoakes@unimelb.edu.au).


These functions are used in the Sydney Speaks project:

Lead by Catherine Travis and funded by ARC Centre of Excellence for the Dynamics of Language.

These tools enhance work in three main ways:

1. Improve data wrangling time efficiency
2. Facilitate visualisation of data
3. Offer accessible options for data analysis
